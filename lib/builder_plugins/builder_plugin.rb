# BuilderPlugin is the superclass of all CC.rb plugins. It does not provide any functionality
# except a basic initializer that accepts as an argument the current project.
# 
# CC.rb plugins offer a rich notification system for tracking every aspect of the build lifecycle. In rough order,
# they are:
#
# * polling_source_control
# * no_new_revisions_detected OR new_revisions_detected(revisions)
# * build_requested
# * queued
# * timed_out
# * build_initiated
# * configuration_modified
# * build_started
# * build_finished
# * release_note_generated
# * release_tagged
# * build_broken OR build_fixed
# * build_loop_failed
# * sleeping
